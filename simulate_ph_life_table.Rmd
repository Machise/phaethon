[Demography 213 - Simulating Data with Proportional Hazards Assumption Starting with a Life Table](http://courses.demog.berkeley.edu/mason213F15/Week10/welcome.pdf)

We first begin by reading in the data. 

```{r}
df = read.table("Data/bltper_5x1.txt", skip = 2, header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

We can then print out the top few rows to make sure that it was inputted correctly:

```{r}
head(df)
```

**lx** is defined as survivorship. 

As we are using a life table to generate 

Import functions to generate lower and upper age on 

```{r}
source("snorkHMD.r")
df = cleanHMD(df)
```
